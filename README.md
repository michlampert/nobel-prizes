## About me

I'm a fifth-year student of computer science. I have 1.5 year of commercial experience as full stack developer. I would like to finally make something useful for humanity (or at least for people of WI AGH). I'm taking my first steps in React - earlier I used Vue.js and Angular. I use Python or Scala as a backend languages.
